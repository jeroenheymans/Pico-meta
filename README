Pico Interpreter in Pico for the course "Interpretation of computerprograms 2" for the 3rd bachelor on the VUB.

Made by Jeroen Heymans

This must not been compiled. To run it, open Make.pco in DrScheme v360 with the spico package and run the code.

This has been tested with these codes:
--------------------------------------


* Switching and communication between 2 threads:

{ i:j:0; p1:p2:void; p1 := {: i:= i+1; p2 :!: val(i); display("p1 sends : ", i, eoln) :}; p2 := {: p1 :?: val(j); display("p2 receives : ", j, eoln) :}; while(i<3,void) }

This should generate an output like:
p2 receives : 1
p1 sends : 1
p2 receives : 2
p1 sends : 2
<void>
